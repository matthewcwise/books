    <p><i><span class="smcap">Walt Whitman</span> has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
            by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies
            to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
            numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
            brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as
            to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by
            allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
            proper thing to love them. And in the sect—fairly large and yet
            unusually choice—of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be
            found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
            novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of</i> Northanger
        Abbey, <i>its completeness, finish, and</i> entrain, <i>obscure the undoubted
            critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
            of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
            difficulty.</i> Persuasion, <i>relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
            in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
            delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of</i> Mansfield Park <i>is admittedly
            theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost<span class="pagenum"><a
                    id="page_x">{x}</a></span>
            wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
            Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might
            very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
            yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and
            others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it.</i> Sense and
        Sensibility <i>has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
            not want them.</i></p>

    </h2>

    <p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>T is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
        of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.</p>

    <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
        first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
        of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
        property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>

    <p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
        Netherfield Park is let at last?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_2">{2}</a></span>”</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>

    <p>“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
        told me all about it.”</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>

    <p>“Do not you want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife, impatiently.</p>

    <p>“<i>You</i> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”</p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption0">
        <img alt="" src="images/i_031.jpg" width="550" id="img_images_i_031.jpg">

                “He came down to see the place”<br>
            </p>

            <p>[<i>Copyright 1894 by George Allen.</i>]</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This was invitation enough.</p>

    <p>“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
        by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
        down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
        delighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is
        to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
        in the house by the end of next week.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_3">{3}</a></span>”</p>

    <p>“What is his name?”</p>

    <p>“Bingley.”</p>

    <p>“Is he married or single?”</p>

    <p>“Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
        five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”</p>

    <p>“How so? how can it affect them?”</p>

    <p>“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome? You
        must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”</p>

    <p>“Is that his design in settling here?”</p>

    <p>“Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
        <i>may</i> fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
        soon as he comes.”
    </p>

    <p>“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go—or you may send
        them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
        as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the
        party.”</p>

    <p>“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <i>have</i> had my share of beauty, but
        I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
        grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”</p>

    <p>“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”</p>

    <p>“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
        the neighbourhood.”</p>

    <p>“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”</p>

    <p>“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
        be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,
        merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new<span class="pagenum"><a
                id="page_4">{4}</a></span>
        comers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for <i>us</i> to visit
        him, if you do not.”</p>

    <p>“You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
        glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
        hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls—though
        I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”</p>

    <p>Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still
        different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return
        for his last.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p class="nind"> “Dear Sir, </p>

        <p>“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will
            soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as
            you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has
            more to give.</p>

        <p>
            “Yours sincerely,” etc.<br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching
        marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to
        Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former
        professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and
        though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much
        kinder answer than she knew was deserved.</p>

    <p>The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was
        as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were
        insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
        being loved by her sister.</p>

    <p>Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
        to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
        Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
        sudden<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_471">{471}</a></span> removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been
        rendered so
        exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that
        Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
        the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
        was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
        meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
        saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
        husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
        listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
        the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
        meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did
        shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his
        forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in
        too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s
        good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she <i>did</i> speak, she must be
        vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at
        all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to
        shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to
        keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might
        converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings
        arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its
        pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward
        with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so
        little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their
        family party at Pemberley.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_472">{472}</a></span></p>

    <h2><a id="CHAPTER_LXI"></a><img alt="" src="images/i_501_a.jpg" width="450" id="img_images_i_501_a.jpg">
        <br><br>CHAPTER LXI.
    </h2>

    <p class="nind"><span class="letra">
            <img alt="H" src="images/i_501_b.png" width="100" id="img_images_i_501_b.png"></span>APPY for all her
        maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
        rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she
        afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be
        guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
        accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of
        her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
        amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,
        it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
        felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous
        and invariably silly.</p>

    <p>Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
        drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
        going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.<span class="pagenum"><a
                id="page_473">{473}</a></span></p>

    <p>Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
        a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
        <i>his</i> easy temper, or <i>her</i> affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
        sisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
        to Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
        of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
    </p>

    <p>Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
        her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
        known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
        temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she
        became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
        ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s
        society she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham
        frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
        balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.</p>

    <p>Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
        drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite
        unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
        she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
        longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,
        it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
        much reluctance.</p>

    <p>As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
        the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
        Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
        and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_474">{474}</a></span> falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in
        spite of
        everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be
        prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which
        Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by
        his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The
        letter was to this effect:—</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p class="nind"> “My dear Lizzy, </p>

        <p>“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear
            Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you
            so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will
            think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very
            much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
            upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four
            hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,
            if you had rather not.</p>

        <p class="rt">
            “Yours,” etc.<br>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in
        her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
        Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
        of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she
        frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
        income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
        their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
        their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
        herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards
        discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
        restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
        extreme. They were always moving from place to place<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_475">{475}</a></span> in
        quest of a
        cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection
        for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,
        in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
        reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never
        receive <i>him</i> at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him
        further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when
        her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the
        Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even
        Bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to <i>talk</i>
        of giving them a hint to be gone.</p>

    <p>Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she
        thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
        dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
        attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
        to Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters
        was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
        other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
        in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
        astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of
        talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
        which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
        pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
        her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a
        woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
        always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.<span class="pagenum"><a
                id="page_476">{476}</a></span></p>

    <p>Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
        and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
        her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
        language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
        all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,
        he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
        and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
        resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
        to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
        them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
        received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
        visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.</p>

    <p>With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,
        as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
        sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
        her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.</p>

            Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
            law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
            so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
            States without permission and without paying copyright
            royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
            of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
            Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
            concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
            and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
            the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
            of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
            copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
            easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
            of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
            Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
            do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
            by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
            license, especially commercial redistribution.

            electronic works
        </div>
        <div>
            1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
            electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
            and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
            (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
            the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
            destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
            possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
            Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
            by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
            or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

        <div>
            1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
            used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
            agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
            things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
            even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
            paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
            Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
            agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
            electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

            1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
            Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
            of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
            works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
            States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
            United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
            claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
            displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
            all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
            that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
            free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
            works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
            Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
            comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
            same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
            you share it without charge with others.
        </div>
        <div>
            1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
            what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
            in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
            check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
            agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
            distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
            other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
            representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
            country other than the United States.

        <div>
            1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
            derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
            contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
            copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

            Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
            either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
            obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™

        </div>
        <div>
            1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
            with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
            must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
            additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
            will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works

            other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
            version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
            (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
            to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
            of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
            Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the

            provided that:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
                the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
                you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
                to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
                agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
                Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
                within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
                legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
                payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
                Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
                Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
                Literary Archive Foundation.”
            </li>
            <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
                you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
                does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
                License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
                copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
                all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
                works.
            </li>
            <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
                any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
                electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
                receipt of the work.
            </li>
            <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
                distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
            Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
            are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
            from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
            the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
            forth in Section 3 below.

            1.F.
        </div>
        <div>
            1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
            effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
            works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
            Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
            electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
            contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
            or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
            intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
            other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
            cannot be read by your equipment.
        </div>
        <div>
            1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
            of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
            Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
            Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
            Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
            liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
            fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
            LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
            PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
            TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
            LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
            INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
            DAMAGE.
        </div>
        <div>
            1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
            defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
            receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
            written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
            received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
            with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
            with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
            lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
            or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
            opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
            the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
            without further opportunities to fix the problem.
        </div>
        <div>
            1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
            in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
            OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
            LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
        </div>
        <div>
            1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
            warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
            damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
            violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
            agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
            limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
            unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
            remaining provisions.
        </div>
        <div>
            1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
            trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
            providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
            accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
            production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
            electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
            including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
            the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
            or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
            additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
            Defect you cause.

        <div>
            Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
            electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
            computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
            exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
            from people in all walks of life.
        </div>
        <div>
            Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
            assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
            goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
            remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
            Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
            and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
            generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

        </div>
        <div>
            Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
            public support and donations to carry out its mission of
            increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
            freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
            array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
            ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
            status with the IRS.

            The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
            where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

            International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

            Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
        </div>
        <div>
            Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
            Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
            freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
            distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
            volunteer support.
        </div>
        <div>
            Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
            editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
            the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
            necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
            edition.
